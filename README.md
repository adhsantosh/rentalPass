# rentalPass
basic rental pass project for algorithm implementation
The Rental Pass platform is a bicycle rental management system developed to provide a seamless experience for both users and administrators. It allows users to browse, rent, and manage bicycle rentals efficiently while offering a personalized recommendation system. Using collaborative filtering, the platform analyzes usersâ€™ rental history and preferences to suggest bicycles they may be interested in, enhancing user engagement and satisfaction.
Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL, Rental Pass features user authentication, an intuitive interface for viewing and renting bicycles, and an administrative dashboard for managing inventory and user interactions. The recommendation algorithm leverages collaborative filtering to predict bicycles of potential interest based on similarities between users' rental patterns, making it a powerful tool for optimizing rental choices. This project demonstrates the integration of recommendation systems within web applications to improve user experience in a digital rental marketplace.
